## Ansible Repository

#### This repository contains several files that I used to practise hands-on ansible in my DevOps learning journey. Basically having a file `install_apache.yml` file which having `yml` based contents.

After crate `install_apache.yml` file then it will execute used `ansible-playbook` command with some other parameters.

``` bash
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_ansible.yml 
```
